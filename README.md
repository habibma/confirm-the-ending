# confirm-the-ending
Check if a string (first argument, str) ends with the given target string (second argument, target)!

This challenge can be solved easily with the .endsWith() method introduced in ES2015. But for the purpose of this challenge (in the freeCodeCamp website for learning JS), they would like us to use one of the JavaScript substring methods instead.

Other solutions use built-in methods; slice() or RegEx method. but, I tried to use a for-loop to resolve this challenge. As there wasn't this solution on the answer sheet, I uploaded it here. I think this shows my different insight and perspective to this challenge.
